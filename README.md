Analysis of our UV data of Acetone (C3H6O) in solution with:
- Water
- Ethane
- Hexane 

We are looking to calculate the peak wavelengths for each solution, excitation energies, hydrogen bonding energies, concentrations, energy per mol of acetone in each solution and their molar extinction coefficients.
